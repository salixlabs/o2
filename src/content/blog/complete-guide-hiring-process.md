# The Complete Guide to Our Hiring Process

**September 18, 2023 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Step 1: Tell Us What You Need

We start by learning about your business, your ideal roles, and the skills you need. Whether you're looking for administrative support, project managers, sales, finance, or technical talent, we tailor our search to your requirements.

## Step 2: We Source and Screen Candidates

Our team taps into Argentina's world-class talent pool, sourcing a large candidate pool for each role. We apply a rigorous multi-stage screening process, including:

- **Culture Index personality testing** to assess fit with your company's values and work style  
- **UCAT intelligence testing** to measure problem-solving and cognitive ability  
- **Resume and experience vetting** to ensure relevant background and skills  
- **Cultural fit interviews** to evaluate communication, professionalism, and English proficiency  

## Step 3: You Meet the Finalists

After our screening, we present you with the top 2–4 finalists for each role. You conduct the final interviews, ask your own questions, and select the candidate who best fits your team.

## Step 4: We Set Up Everything

Once you've made your hire, OfficeTwo handles all the logistics: office space, hardware, software, payroll setup, and onboarding support. Your new team member is ready to hit the ground running from day one.

## Step 5: Your Team Starts Working

Your new employee joins our Buenos Aires office, collaborating daily with your U.S. team. We ensure a smooth integration and provide ongoing support to maximize productivity and engagement.

## Step 6: We Stay Involved

Our support doesn't end after onboarding. OfficeTwo provides continuous HR, IT, and operational support, plus training and retention help to keep your team happy and high-performing.

## How Long Does It Take?

Most hiring processes take 4–6 weeks from kickoff to your employee's start date, depending on the complexity of the role and your interview availability.

## No Minimums, No Long-Term Contracts

Start with one hire or build a full team—there's no minimum contract term. Our simple, flat monthly fee begins once you hire your first employee.
