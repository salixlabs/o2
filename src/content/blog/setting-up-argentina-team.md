# Setting Up Your Argentina Team: Legal and Practical Considerations

**November 8, 2022 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Why Buenos Aires?

Buenos Aires is a city of over 15 million people, with a deep pool of highly educated, ambitious professionals. OfficeTwo's centrally located offices in Belgrano put you right in the heart of this talent market—millions of potential applicants live within a short drive or even walking distance of our workspace. This means you can attract top-tier candidates who want the convenience and prestige of working in a modern, centrally located office.

## No Local Entity Required

One of the biggest hurdles for U.S. companies hiring abroad is the need to set up a local business entity. With OfficeTwo, you don't have to. We handle all the legal and practical details, so you can hire and manage your Argentina team without the headaches of local incorporation.

## Payroll, Compliance, and More—Handled for You

From payroll and benefits administration to compliance with Argentine labor laws, OfficeTwo takes care of everything. We ensure your team is paid accurately and on time, all required taxes and contributions are handled, and you stay compliant with local regulations. This lets you focus on growing your business, not on paperwork.

## Modern Workspace and Full Support

Your team will work from our Belgrano office, equipped with everything they need: high-speed internet, modern workstations, meeting rooms, and a collaborative environment. We also provide ongoing HR, IT, and operational support to keep your team happy and productive.
