# Setting Up Your Argentina Team With Full Support

Setting up an international team can feel overwhelmingâ€”especially when it involves unfamiliar regulations, payroll systems, and office logistics. But with the right partner, building a high-performing team in Argentina is not only possibleâ€”itâ€™s seamless.  

At OfficeTwo, we help U.S. companies hire top talent in Buenos Aires without the need for a local entity. From legal compliance to daily operations, we handle the details so you can focus on growth.  

If youâ€™re exploring how to set up a team in Argentina, this guide breaks down the practical and legal stepsâ€”minus the complexity.

## Why Buenos Aires Is Ideal for U.S. Teams

When it comes to building an international workforce, Buenos Aires offers one of the strongest value propositions in Latin America.  

With over 15 million residents, the city boasts a deep pool of skilled, English-proficient professionals across operations, finance, engineering, customer service, and more.  

At OfficeTwo, we operate out of a modern workspace in **Belgrano**â€”one of Buenos Aires' most accessible and vibrant districts. Our location gives you direct access to a large talent base, many of whom live within walking distance or a short commute from our office.

## No Local Entity Required

For many U.S. companies, the biggest obstacle to setting up a team in Argentina is the legal complexity of establishing a local entity.  

With OfficeTwo, thatâ€™s no longer necessary. We eliminate the need for incorporation, entity registration, or legal setupâ€”so you can start hiring quickly and compliantly without local infrastructure.
