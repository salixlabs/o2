# Physical Office vs. Remote Work: Why Location Still Matters

**May 3, 2024 · OfficeTwo Team**

## The Rise of Hybrid Work

Over the past few years, remote work has become a global norm. But at OfficeTwo, we've found that the best results come from a hybrid model—where team members spend some days working from home and some days together in a physical office. This approach offers the flexibility employees want, while preserving the collaboration and culture that drive business success.

## Why In-Person Collaboration Still Matters

There's no substitute for the energy and connection that comes from working side by side with your team. In a physical office, employees can:

- Build stronger relationships and trust  
- Share knowledge and solve problems faster  
- Onboard and train more effectively  
- Feel a sense of belonging and shared purpose  

These advantages are important for any company, but they're especially critical when building an international team.

## The Unique Value of Office Time for International Teams

When you hire internationally, your team members face additional challenges: new cultures, different time zones, and the need for extra support. A physical office provides a built-in support network—colleagues who understand the local context, can answer questions in real time, and help new hires feel connected to your company's mission.

For international employees, in-person time isn't just about productivity—it's about confidence, growth, and long-term retention. The office becomes a place where they can:

- Get immediate help with technical or process issues  
- Receive mentorship and coaching from experienced peers  
- Participate in team-building activities and company culture  
- Develop language and communication skills in a supportive environment  

## Our Approach: The Best of Both Worlds

At OfficeTwo, we design our work model around flexibility and connection. Most of our clients' teams follow a hybrid schedule—typically 2–3 days in the office, and the rest remote. This balance gives employees autonomy, while ensuring they get the in-person support and camaraderie that make international teams thrive.

## Conclusion: Location Still Matters

Remote work is here to stay, but the physical office remains a powerful tool for building high-performing, resilient teams—especially across borders. By combining the best of both worlds, you can unlock greater productivity, engagement, and success for your business and your people.
