# Building a Bilingual Team: English Proficiency in Buenos Aires

**December 5, 2023 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Argentina Leads Latin America in English Proficiency

When building an international team, strong English skills are a must for seamless communication. Argentina stands out as a leader in this area. According to the 2024 EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), Argentina scored **562**, ranking **#28 out of 116 countries** globally and placing in the **High Proficiency** band. Most notably, Argentina is ranked **#1 in Latin America** for English proficiency—well ahead of other countries in the region.

## Buenos Aires: A Hub for English-Speaking Talent

Within Argentina, Buenos Aires is the epicenter of English-speaking professionals. The city boasts a city-level EF EPI score of **584**, also in the High Proficiency band. This is among the highest scores for any city in Latin America, reflecting a deep pool of talent comfortable working in English every day.

## What Does This Mean for Your Team?

When you hire in Buenos Aires, you're tapping into a workforce that can communicate effectively with U.S. colleagues and clients. Most professionals in the city have studied English from a young age, and many have experience working with international companies. This makes onboarding, training, and day-to-day collaboration much smoother than in many other offshore destinations.

## Accents and Real-World Communication

It's important to note that while English proficiency is high, most Argentines will have an accent. This is completely normal—and for most roles, perfect, accent-free English isn't required. What matters most is clear communication, professionalism, and the ability to understand and be understood. In our experience, Argentine team members excel in all of these areas, and their language skills only improve with time and practice.

## Why Bilingual Teams Succeed

- Stronger collaboration with U.S. teams  
- Better customer support and client communication  
- Faster onboarding and training  
- Greater flexibility for global growth
