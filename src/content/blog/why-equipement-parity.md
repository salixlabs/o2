# Why Tech Equipment Parity Matters for International Teams

When building international teams, one of the most impactful decisions you can make is ensuring complete tech equipment parity between your US and international team members. Here's why providing identical setups matters—and how it pays off in productivity and team cohesion.

## The Power of Equipment Parity

If your US team works on MacBooks with external monitors, your Argentina team should have the exact same setup. This isn't just about fairness—it's about:

- Eliminating technical friction between teams  
- Ensuring consistent performance and capabilities  
- Creating a sense of equality and inclusion  
- Maximizing productivity across all locations  

## The Second Monitor Standard

Regardless of role, we strongly recommend providing dual monitors for every team member. The productivity benefits are clear:

- 40% increase in productivity for most tasks  
- Easier collaboration during video calls  
- More effective multitasking  
- Reduced context switching  

## Beyond Just Hardware

True tech parity extends beyond just physical equipment. It includes:

- Identical software licenses and subscriptions  
- Same security tools and VPN access  
- Equal access to internal tools and resources  
- Consistent IT support standards  

## The Hidden Costs of Inequality

Failing to provide equal tech setups can lead to:

- Reduced productivity and efficiency  
- Technical complications during collaboration  
- Feelings of "second-class citizenship"  
- Unnecessary workarounds and friction  

## Our Approach

At OfficeTwo, we ensure every team member gets the same high-quality setup:

- Latest MacBook Pro or equivalent  
- High-quality 27" external monitor  
- Full suite of necessary peripherals  
- Complete software package  

**Remember**: Your international team members aren't just remote workers—they're full members of your team. Their tools should reflect that.
