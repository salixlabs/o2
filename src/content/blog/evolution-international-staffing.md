# The Evolution of International Staffing: Beyond Traditional Models

**July 22, 2022 · OfficeTwo Team**

## From Outsourcing to Integration: A Decade of Change

Ten years ago, the international hiring landscape was dominated by outsourcing entry-level roles to the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These regions became the go-to for virtual assistants, customer support, and basic back-office functions—primarily because of cost savings. However, the model often meant teams were isolated, communication was challenging, and integration with U.S. operations was limited.

## The Rise of LATAM in Global Talent

In recent years, Latin America has emerged as a major player in the international hiring scene. With strong English proficiency, cultural alignment, and time zone overlap with the U.S., countries like Argentina are now attracting companies looking for more than just cost savings. Businesses want real collaboration, higher-level skills, and teams that feel like a true extension of their U.S. office.

## OfficeTwo: The Next Step in International Staffing

OfficeTwo is narrowing the gap even further. Instead of just hiring remote workers, we help you build fully integrated teams in Buenos Aires that operate much like another U.S. office. Your team works together in a modern, centrally located office, with all the support, training, and culture-building you'd expect from a domestic team. The result? Seamless collaboration, higher retention, and a true sense of belonging—for both your Argentina team and your U.S. headquarters.

## Why This Model Works

- Real-time communication and collaboration  
- Shared culture and values  
- Access to top-tier talent for mid- and senior-level roles  
- Greater loyalty and long-term retention  
- All the cost advantages of international hiring, without the downsides of traditional outsourcing  

## The Future of Global Teams

The world of international staffing is evolving fast. Companies no longer have to choose between cost savings and quality, or between flexibility and integration. With OfficeTwo, you can build a global team that feels like a natural extension of your business—fully supported, fully engaged, and ready to help you grow.
