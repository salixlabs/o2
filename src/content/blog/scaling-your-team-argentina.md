# Scaling Your Team: From One Hire to a Full Department

**April 5, 2022 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Start Small, Grow Big

One of the most common patterns we see at OfficeTwo is companies starting with just one or two hires in Buenos Aires. They want to test the waters, see how the model works, and ensure a good fit before making a larger commitment. This approach allows for a smooth integration and gives both the company and the new team members time to adjust and build trust.

## Scaling Up as You See Results

What often happens next is remarkable: after a year or two, companies that initially planned to keep their Argentina team small start hiring more and more. The reason? They see the results—higher productivity, strong retention, and seamless collaboration with their U.S. team. Success breeds confidence, and before long, what started as a small experiment becomes a core part of the company's operations.

## Some Start Big from Day One

Of course, not every company starts small. Some clients come to us ready to build a full department right from the beginning. They know the value of a fully integrated, in-person team and want to hit the ground running with multiple hires across different roles. Our infrastructure and support make it easy to scale quickly, whether you're adding one person or a dozen.
