# The Real Cost Advantage: Hiring in Buenos Aires vs. U.S. Markets

**September 30, 2024 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Looking Beyond Salary: The True Cost Advantage

When U.S. companies consider hiring internationally, the first thing that comes to mind is often lower salaries. While it's true that hiring in Buenos Aires can reduce payroll costs by 40–60% compared to major U.S. cities, the real advantage goes much deeper. The most significant savings come from the quality and impact of the talent you're able to attract—and the way that talent transforms your business performance.

## Access to World-Class Talent

Buenos Aires is home to a highly educated, ambitious, and globally minded workforce. The city's universities and technical schools produce thousands of skilled professionals each year, many of whom are fluent in English and experienced working with international teams. This means you're not just saving money—you're gaining access to individuals who can drive your company forward.

## Performance That Pays Off

High-caliber employees don't just fill seats—they solve problems, innovate, and help your company grow. Teams in Buenos Aires are known for their strong work ethic, adaptability, and ability to take ownership of complex projects. The result? Faster onboarding, higher productivity, and better outcomes for your business. These performance gains often outweigh the initial salary savings.

## Retention and Engagement

Another hidden cost in U.S. hiring is turnover. In Buenos Aires, employees value stability, growth opportunities, and a positive work environment. With OfficeTwo's in-person office model and ongoing support, you'll see higher retention rates and a more engaged team—reducing the costs and disruptions of frequent rehiring.

## All-Inclusive Support, No Hidden Fees

OfficeTwo's model includes everything your team needs to succeed: modern office space, HR and payroll support, IT setup, and ongoing management. There are no surprise costs or administrative headaches—just a single, transparent monthly fee. This allows you to plan and budget with confidence, knowing that your team is fully supported.

## Case Study: More Than Just Savings

One of our clients, a U.S. real estate firm, initially chose Buenos Aires for the cost savings. But what surprised them most was the level of professionalism, initiative, and problem-solving their new team brought to the table. The result was not just a lower payroll, but a more efficient, higher-performing company overall.

## The Bottom Line

Hiring in Buenos Aires isn't just about saving money—it's about building a better business. The real cost advantage comes from unlocking world-class talent, improving performance, and creating a team that helps your company thrive.
