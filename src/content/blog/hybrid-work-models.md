# Hybrid Work Models: Balancing Office and Remote Time

**June 30, 2023 · OfficeTwo Team**

## The Hybrid Model: Flexibility Meets Connection

At OfficeTwo, we've seen firsthand how hybrid work models can deliver the best of both worlds: the flexibility of remote work and the connection of in-person collaboration. Most of our clients find that having their team in the office just 1–2 days per week is enough to foster strong relationships, enable effective training, and solve problems quickly. The remaining 3–4 days can be spent working from home, giving employees the autonomy and work-life balance they value.

## Why In-Office Time Still Matters

Even a small amount of in-person time makes a big difference. Those 1–2 days per week in the office are ideal for:

- Onboarding and training new hires  
- Team building and culture development  
- Collaborative problem solving and brainstorming  
- Regular check-ins and feedback sessions  

## Special Recommendation: Intensive Office Time for New Hires

For the first few weeks of training a new hire—or when an employee is promoted to a new position—we recommend that they work in the office 5 days a week. This concentrated in-person time accelerates learning, builds confidence, and helps new team members integrate quickly. After this initial period, they can transition to the standard hybrid schedule.

## Office Access: Always Available

While most companies only require 1–2 days per week in the office, OfficeTwo's workspace is always open. If an employee doesn't have a conducive setup for work at home, or simply prefers the office environment, they are welcome to work from the office 5 days a week. We believe in providing the flexibility and support each team member needs to do their best work.

## Finding the Right Balance

Hybrid work isn't one-size-fits-all. The right mix of office and remote time depends on your team's needs, your company culture, and the nature of the work. At OfficeTwo, we help you design a schedule that maximizes productivity, engagement, and satisfaction for everyone.
