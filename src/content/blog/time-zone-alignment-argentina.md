# Time Zone Alignment: The Hidden Advantage of Hiring in Argentina

**March 12, 2024 · OfficeTwo Team**

## Argentina: Practically in Sync with the U.S.

One of the biggest challenges of building an international team is managing time zones. But when you hire in Buenos Aires, you get a hidden advantage: Argentina is only one hour ahead of Eastern Time and just four hours ahead of Pacific Time. This means your team in Buenos Aires can work in near real-time with your U.S. headquarters—no late-night meetings or awkward handoffs required.

## West Coast Companies: Overlap Is Easier Than You Think

For companies based on the West Coast, a four-hour time difference might sound like a hurdle. But in practice, it's surprisingly easy to achieve overlapping work hours. Why? Because Argentine culture naturally runs later than in the U.S. Most Argentines wake up later, eat dinner at 9 or 10pm, and go to bed much later than their American counterparts. For them, working from noon to 8pm—or even later—isn't hard or unusual. In fact, many prefer it.

## Real-World Collaboration

Our West Coast clients at OfficeTwo consistently report that their Buenos Aires teams are available and engaged during core business hours. Whether you need to schedule a team meeting at 3pm Pacific or get real-time support at the end of your workday, you'll find your Argentina team is ready and responsive.

## Benefits of Seamless Time Zone Alignment

- Faster project turnaround and decision-making  
- Real-time communication and collaboration  
- No need for late-night or early-morning meetings  
- Greater sense of team unity and shared culture  

## Why It Matters for International Teams

Time zone alignment isn't just a convenience—it's a strategic advantage. It means your international team can participate fully in your company's daily rhythm, contribute to meetings, and respond quickly to new opportunities. This level of integration is hard to achieve with teams in Asia or Eastern Europe, where the time difference can be 8–12 hours or more.

## Ready to Experience the Advantage?

If you want to build a high-performing, truly collaborative international team, Argentina's time zone makes it possible. Let OfficeTwo show you how easy it can be to work across borders—without missing a beat.
