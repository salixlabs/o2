            <p class="blog-excerpt">How to build a strong company culture and keep your team engaged across borders.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge of Retaining International Talent</h2>
            <p>Building a high-performing international team is only half the battle—keeping your best people is just as important. At OfficeTwo, we know that retention is driven by more than just salary. It's about creating an environment where employees feel valued, supported, and truly part of a team.</p>

            <h2>How OfficeTwo Drives Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Office Space & In-Person Culture:</strong> Our Buenos Aires office provides a professional, collaborative environment where employees can connect, learn, and grow together. The sense of belonging and camaraderie is a major factor in long-term satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Training:</strong> We offer continuous learning opportunities and support, so team members can develop new skills and advance in their roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Workplace Culture:</strong> From team lunches to company events, we foster a positive, inclusive culture that makes people want to stay.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Manager Support:</strong> Every client is paired with a dedicated account manager who checks in regularly with both the company and the employee. This ensures that any issues are addressed early, and that both sides are happy with the arrangement—boosting satisfaction and retention for everyone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Power of Team Belonging</h2>
            <p>Remote work can be isolating, especially for international employees. By providing a real office and a real team, OfficeTwo helps employees feel like they're part of something bigger. This sense of connection leads to higher engagement, better performance, and a stronger commitment to your company's mission.</p>

            <h2>Long-Term Results</h2>
            <p>While the average tenure at a small U.S. company is around 3 years, we've built long-term teams in Buenos Aires that often exceed this benchmark—thanks to the support, culture, and collaboration fostered in our in-person office environment.</p>

            <h2>Ready to Build a Team That Stays?</h2>
