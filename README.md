This is a simple MVP go-to-market website for a new company called "OfficeTwo". The domain is https://officetwo.com.

Tagline should be "We help companies build their second office in Buenos Aires"

OfficeTwo is a company that sources talent from Buenos Aires to work remotely for companies in the US. Beyond simply sourcing talent, we also provide a physical office space for the talent to work in, which is fully-equipped with the latest technology and tools. We also provide a range of other services which are all included, such as onboarding, training, tech support, technology hardware, help with compliance and taxes, ongoing account management, and more. We are your HR department for your second office in Buenos Aires. 

Rather than hiring a virtual assistant somewhere on the other side of the world, you can hire highly talented people who will be full team members in your company. Because the approach is much more similar to hiring a second office locally in the USA, we can hire positions that are typically only found by hiring domestically, including mid-level and senior positions that require problem solving skills, creativity, and more. We can hire all sorts of back-office positions, including entry-level roles such as a CSR team and data entry, as well as more senior roles such as a Customer Success Managers, Product Managers, Project Managers, Sales Managers, and more. 

The homepage should be a simple landing page that explains the concept of OfficeTwo and the benefits of hiring through us. It should mimic modern SAAS landing pages and be modern and clean.

We should also have a blog section where we can post blogs and FAQ articles, and we should setup the site from the beginning to use the same design and formatting for all the blog pages. It should be simple for us to add new blog posts without having to rewrite the style sheet.
