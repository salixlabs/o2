                            <p>OfficeTwo helps you build a true back office team that can solve complex problems and manage high-responsibility roles—far beyond what typical remote "virtual assistants" can offer.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely. Buenos Aires has a highly educated talent pool of over 15 million people. With your U.S. budget, you can often hire top-tier candidates in Argentina instead of settling for lower-quality applicants locally.</p>

                            <p>The U.S. has great talent, but most top candidates are hired by large firms at salaries small businesses can't afford. In Argentina, where the cost of living is lower, small businesses can compete for elite talent and build strong, reliable teams.</p>

                            <p>Yes. OfficeTwo specializes in sourcing talent capable of mid- and upper-level roles like Project Managers, Sales Managers, and more—not just basic administrative tasks.</p>

                            <p>Team members work exclusively for your company, but they are officially engaged and managed by OfficeTwo. You decide how much to pay your team member—we’ll advise on local market rates, but the final decision is yours. You then pay OfficeTwo a single monthly invoice that includes the team member’s compensation and our flat service fee. We handle everything behind the scenes, including sourcing, payroll, compliance, and office support—so you can stay focused on growing your business.</p>
